This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. For many businesses, being well-architected for reliability is a key requirement for SAP workloads. This is due to the mission critical nature of many SAP workloads and a need to understand the SAP architecture and the restrictions this imposes. As with other pillars, we recommend reviewing the AWS Well-Architected Framework, particularly for the best practices of foundations, change management, and failure management. When considering reliability with the SAP Lens, focus first on having a clear and balanced understanding of your non-functional requirements across individual systems, including the business priorities that drive these requirements. We then differentiate between availability and disaster recovery (DR). Availability relates to scenarios where it is possible for an end user to continue accessing the SAP system despite a component failure. In contrast, in a scenario in which the entire workload becomes unavailable, a DR event would be declared.",

Work backwards from your business requirements to define an approach for meeting the availability goals of your SAP infrastructure and data. For each failure scenario, the resiliency requirements, acceptable data loss, and mean time to recover (MTTR) need to be proportionate to the criticality of the component and the business applications it supports. Select from one of the AWS Documented architecture  patterns and evaluate based on criteria you define. These criteria should include the perceived risk and impact for each failure as well as taking into consideration cost and performance. In all cases, use initial and periodic testing to validate your decisions.",

SAP architectures, as a rule, become more environmentally sustainable as underlying infrastructure footprints and energy utilization are reduced. For most cases where the SAP workload resides in AWS, this aligns with a more cost-optimized cloud infrastructure. For instance, running fewer instances with a higher utilization, as described in the Well-Architected Framework Sustainability Pillar, is a standard method of achieving a lower-cost footprint. Business stakeholders and SAP architecture teams must keep in mind that this can require changes in business objectives to prioritize sustainability over performance goals. In addition, stakeholders should encourage the adoption of iterative code development practices that optimize for energy efficiency over time.",

They must understand and justify the rationale behind those choices. If business leaders cannot describe what tradeoffs they must make in the language of sustainability and energy efficiency, they will have difficulty making decisions based on those criteria. Production SAP workloads are mission critical to most businesses who run SAP, with companies often prioritizing reliability and performance efficiency over infrastructure costs. While prioritizing sustainability almost always results in cloud infrastructure cost reductions, it might not create overall cost savings for an SAP workload. Running SAP workloads in a more sustainable fashion in AWS can increase the costs of software, personnel, or overall business functions. To meet sustainability goals, these tradeoffs along with other priorities must be clearly articulated, agreed upon, and measurable. (Best Practice 21.1)",
